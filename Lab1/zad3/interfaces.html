                    Aristotle was probably the first to begin a careful study of the concept of type; he spoke of
                    “the class of fishes and the class of birds.” The idea that all objects, while being unique, are
                    also part of a class of objects that have characteristics and behaviors in common was used
                    directly in the first object-oriented language, Simula-67, with its fundamental keyword class
                    that introduces a new type into a program.

                    Simula, as its name implies, was created for developing simulations such as the classic “bank
                    teller problem.” In this, you have numerous tellers, customers, accounts, transactions, and
                    units of money—a lot of “objects.” Objects that are identical except for their state during a
                    program’s execution are grouped together into “classes of objects,” and that’s where the
                    keyword class came from. Creating abstract data types (classes) is a fundamental concept in
                    object-oriented programming. Abstract data types work almost exactly like built-in types:
                    You can create variables of a type (called objects or instances in object-oriented parlance)
                    and manipulate those variables (called sending messages or requests; you send a message
                    and the object figures out what to do with it). The members (elements) of each class share
                    some commonality: Every account has a balance, every teller can accept a deposit, etc. At the
                    same time, each member has its own state: Each account has a different balance, each teller
                    has a name. Thus, the tellers, customers, accounts, transactions, etc., can each be
                    represented with a unique entity in the computer program. This entity is the object, and each
                    object belongs to a particular class that defines its characteristics and behaviors.

                    So, although what we really do in object-oriented programming is create new data types,
                    virtually all object-oriented programming languages use the “class” keyword. When you see
                    the word “type” think “class” and vice versa.

                    Since a class describes a set of objects that have identical characteristics (data elements) and
                    behaviors (functionality), a class is really a data type because a floating point number, for
                    example, also has a set of characteristics and behaviors. The difference is that a programmer
                    defines a class to fit a problem rather than being forced to use an existing data type that was
                    designed to represent a unit of storage in a machine. You extend the programming language
                    by adding new data types specific to your needs. The programming system welcomes the new
                    classes and gives them all the care and type checking that it gives to built-in types.
                    The object-oriented approach is not limited to building simulations. Whether or not you
                    agree that any program is a simulation of the system you’re designing, the use of OOP
                    techniques can easily reduce a large set of problems to a simple solution.
                                                                                
                    Once a class is established, you can make as many objects of that class as you like, and then
                    manipulate those objects as if they are the elements that exist in the problem you are trying
                    to solve. Indeed, one of the challenges of object-oriented programming is to create a one-toone
                    mapping between the elements in the problem space and objects in the solution space.
                    But how do you get an object to do useful work for you? There needs to be a way to make a
                    request of the object so that it will do something, such as complete a transaction, draw
                    something on the screen, or turn on a switch. And each object can satisfy only certain
                    requests. The requests you can make of an object are defined by its interface, and the type is
                    what determines the interface. A simple example might be a representation of a light bulb:
                </pre>
                <img src="bulb.png" style="width: 70%; height: auto;">
                <pre>
                    The interface determines the requests that you can make for a particular object. However,
                    there must be code somewhere to satisfy that request. This, along with the hidden data,
                    comprises the implementation. From a procedural programming standpoint, it’s not that
                    complicated. A type has a method associated with each possible request, and when you make
                    a particular request to an object, that method is called. This process is usually summarized by
                    saying that you “send a message” (make a request) to an object, and the object figures out
                    what to do with that message (it executes code).

                    Here, the name of the type/class is Light, the name of this particular Light object is lt, and
                    the requests that you can make of a Light object are to turn it on, turn it off, make it
                    brighter, or make it dimmer. You create a Light object by defining a “reference” (lt) for that
                    object and calling new to request a new object of that type. To send a message to the object,
                    you state the name of the object and connect it to the message request with a period (dot).
                    From the standpoint of the user of a predefined class, that’s pretty much all there is to
                    programming with objects.

                    The preceding diagram follows the format of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Each
                    class is represented by a box, with the type name in the top portion of the box, any data
                    members that you care to describe in the middle portion of the box, and the methods (the
                    functions that belong to this object, which receive any messages you send to that object) in
                    the bottom portion of the box. Often, only the name of the class and the public methods are
                    shown in UML design diagrams, so the middle portion is not shown, as in this case. If you’re
                    interested only in the class name, then the bottom portion doesn’t need to be shown, either.
