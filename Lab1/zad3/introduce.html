                        I originally approached Java as “just another programming
                        language,” which in many senses it is.

                        But as time passed and I studied it more deeply, I began to see that the fundamental intent of
                        this language was different from other languages I had seen up to that point.

                        Programming is about managing complexity: the complexity of the problem you want to
                        solve, laid upon the complexity of the machine in which it is solved. Because of this
                        complexity, most of our programming projects fail. And yet, of all the programming
                        languages of which I am aware, almost none have gone all out and decided that their main
                        design goal would be to conquer the complexity of developing and maintaining programs.1 Of
                        course, many language design decisions were made with complexity in mind, but at some
                        point there were always other issues that were considered essential to be added into the mix.
                        Inevitably, those other issues are what cause programmers to eventually “hit the wall” with
                        that language. For example, C++ had to be backwards-compatible with C (to allow easy
                        migration for C programmers), as well as efficient. Those are both very useful goals and
                        account for much of the success of C++, but they also expose extra complexity that prevents
                        some projects from being finished (certainly, you can blame programmers and management,
                        but if a language can help by catching your mistakes, why shouldn’t it?). As another example,
                        Visual BASIC (VB) was tied to BASIC, which wasn’t really designed to be an extensible
                        language, so all the extensions piled upon VB have produced some truly unmaintainable
                        syntax. Perl is backwards-compatible with awk, sed, grep, and other Unix tools it was meant
                        to replace, and as a result it is often accused of producing “write-only code” (that is, after a
                        while you can’t read it). On the other hand, C++, VB, Perl, and other languages like Smalltalk
                        had some of their design efforts focused on the issue of complexity and as a result are
                        remarkably successful in solving certain types of problems.

                        What has impressed me most as I have come to understand Java is that somewhere in the
                        mix of Sun’s design objectives, it seems that there was a goal of reducing complexity for the
                        programmer. As if to say, “We care about reducing the time and difficulty of producing
                        robust code.” In the early days, this goal resulted in code that didn’t run very fast (although
                        this has improved over time), but it has indeed produced amazing reductions in development
                        time—half or less of the time that it takes to create an equivalent C++ program. This result
                        alone can save incredible amounts of time and money, but Java doesn’t stop there. It goes on
                        to wrap many of the complex tasks that have become important, such as multithreading and
                        network programming, in language features or libraries that can at times make those tasks
                        easy. And finally, it tackles some really big complexity problems: cross-platform programs,
                        dynamic code changes, and even security, each of which can fit on your complexity spectrum
                        anywhere from “impediment” to “show-stopper.” So despite the performance problems that
                        we’ve seen, the promise of Java is tremendous: It can make us significantly more productive
                        programmers.

                        In all ways—creating the programs, working in teams, building user interfaces to
                        communicate with the user, running the programs on different types of machines, and easily
                        writing programs that communicate across the Internet—Java increases the communication
                        bandwidth between people.

                        I think that the results of the communication revolution may not be seen from the effects of
                        moving large quantities of bits around. We shall see the true revolution because we will all
                        communicate with each other more easily: one-on-one, but also in groups and as a planet.
